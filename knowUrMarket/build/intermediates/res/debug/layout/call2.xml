\nThe breakeven point is quite easy to calculate for a call option:
\n\n
Breakeven Stock Price = Call Option Strike Price + Premium Paid
\nTo illustrate, the trader purchased the $52.50 strike price call option for $0.60. Therefore, $52.50 + $0.60 = $53.10. The trader will breakeven, excluding commissions/slippage, if the stock reaches $53.10 by expiration.
\n\n
Profit
\nTo calculate profits or losses on a call option use the following simple formula:
\n\n
Call Option Profit/Loss = Stock Price at Expiration - Breakeven Point
\nFor every dollar the stock price rises once the $53.10 breakeven barrier has been surpassed, there is a dollar for dollar profit for the options contract. So if the stock gains $5.00 to $55.00 by expiration, the owner of the the call option would make $1.90 per share ($55.00 stock price - $53.10 breakeven stock price). So total, the trader would have made $190 ($1.90 x 100 shares/contract).
\n\n
Partial Loss
\nIf the stock price increased by $2.75 to close at $52.75 by expiration, the option trader would lose money. For this example, the trader would have lost $0.35 per contract ($52.75 stock price - $53.10 breakeven stock price). Therefore, the hypothetical trader would have lost $35 (-$0.35 x 100 shares/contract).
\n\n
To summarize, in this partial loss example, the option trader bought a call option because they thought that the stock was going to rise. The trader was right, the stock did rise by $2.75, however, the trader was not right enough. The stock needed to move higher by at least $3.10 to $53.10 to breakeven or make money.
\n\n
Complete Loss
\nIf the stock did not move higher than the strike price of the option contract by expiration, the option trader would lose their entire premium paid $0.60. Likewise, if the stock moved down, irrelavent by how much it moved downward, then the option trader would still lose the $0.60 paid for the option. In either of those two circumstances, the trader would have lost $60 (-$0.60 x 100 shares/contract)."/>
